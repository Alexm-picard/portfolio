                    Hi, my name is <span>Alex Picard,</span>
                    and I am Computer Engineering Student.
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Some things about me are that I am currently enrolled in my third year of university at the 
                    University of Maine in the process of completing my B.S. In my free time, I like to go to the gym, take pictures,
                     and learn new things. I am from a small town in Maine called Caribou, but currently for school 
                     I have an apartment in the Bangor, Maine area. I am open to various opportunities of careers within computers, but my current 
                     specialties include Software and Firmware Development. I am open to relocating to Boston Area without the need for a Housing stipend, 
                     or with a housing stipend, I am willing to be anywhere in the U.S. as that is the only country I am a legal resident.

                    <h4>Information about me</h4>
                    <p> As previously stated on the home page, I'm from Caribou, Maine and 
                        have done many different things from sports all four years of high school
                        to have completed 30 credit hours and getting my rank of Eagle Scout and 
                        Brotherhood in the Scouts and the Order of the Arrow respectively. I am great at
                        picking things up inside of a lab or work environment as I think the difference 
                        in ECE GPA and cumulative GPA compare. I have taught myself many things along
                        the way including Python, Java, and Web Development packages, along with
                         basic machine learning and neural network techniques.

                            This project was the final project for ECE 275 Sequential Logic Systems and it 
                            used a Quartus II Cyclone III FPGA and the basic controls were the switches
                            for moving up and down, while a button on the FPGA was used to reset to the 
                            starting state. The game also included lives through the colors of the paddles.
                            the green is full of lives, yellow means you lost one life, orange is you've lost two lives,
                            and being on red means that there's one life left. Also to make the game harder, there is 
                            a hard mode implemented where it turns the ball into the background color to hide where it is 
                            going until it reaches around 100 pixels away from the side walls.

                        <p>
                            This project was the final project for ECE 210 where we went through the whole process of developing a 
                            DC-DC boost converter. Through this project, we did all the math needed, along with running simulations 
                            with Ngspice, and MATLAB. Once our design met the design specification, we implemented it on a breadboard
                            and debugged it until we met the specifications through measuring tools such as the Analog Digilent II and 
                            a voltmeter. Finally, throughout the process, we had to document our process steps and report them in a technical report.

                            This project is the current webpage you are looking at currently where I had the help from freeCodeAcademy portfolio video, but as 
                            I learn more about Web Development the more this website will change with plans to learn and implement React, node.js and turn it into
                            a full-stack project and not just a frontend. Current technologies used are HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

                                        Extension of ECE 210 introducing frequency response, basic filters, Bode plots, and Fourier Series, with lab exercise and 
                                        circuit simulations to demonstrate concepts. Participants become familiar with circuit simulation, safety, and grounding 
                                        considerations, instrumentation, e.g., oscilloscopes, signal sources, multimeters, and signal analyzers. Also of particular 
                                        significance will be the development of technical writing skills.

                                        An introduction to calculus for students in mathematics, engineering, and the sciences. Covers the differential calculus 
                                        of the algebraic, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, concluding with the definite integral and the 
                                        fundamental theorem of calculus. The approach is intuitive and geometric, with an emphasis on understanding the basic concepts 
                                        of function, limit, derivative and integral.

                                        Machine Learning is the study of how to build computer systems that learn from experience. It is a subfield of 
                                        Artificial Intelligence and requires a good background knowledge in linear algebra (LA) and probability. The course will 
                                        explain how to build systems that learn and adapt using examples from real-world applications. Main topics covered in this 
                                        course includes supervised learning such as classification and regression, lasso, feature selection, neural networks, 
                                        random forest, support vector machines, unsupervised learning like PCA, clustering, and GMM, 
                                        deep convolutional neural network, generative adversarial networks, and reinforcement learning.

                                         installed in factories for automatic production. In this course, the students will focus on getting a taste of and 
                                         understanding the basics of a wide range of robotics technology, including mathematical fundamentals, algorithms, and 
                                         programming. The students will learn the basic algorithms for robotic perception (understanding the world around the robot),
                                          mapping (creating a model of the environment around the robot), localization (tracking the position of the robot in the 
                                          environment), planning, and control (robotic decision-making to achieve a desired outcome).
